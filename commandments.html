    When Coronavirus halted my studies for three weeks in my junior year of college, I returned to one of my first loves, Movies. I had three weeks where my life had, for lack of a better term, ceased to exist, and time could be spent doing anything within my home. I flicked through my infinite subscriptions, seeing them become more like the cable packages my family used to debate with Comcast. After a few Netflix originals that seemed to be nothing more than alternative Hallmark films, and excruciatingly bland Hulu movies, I began to see cracks forming in my once beloved pastime.<br><br>
    In becoming the standard vehicle of entertainment, streaming sites had devolved into capitalistic entertainment machines, ruthlessly adapting and drawing out any kind of profitable entertainment. The plot of each film, the timeline of each show, began to blend together, becoming such a mishmash of insignificant plot and scene, it felt like it was almost inhuman.<br> <br>
    Suddenly, any film regardless of genre became nothing but formula. Storytelling had become nothing more but an input, and cash, subscriptions and notoriety had become the outputs. I had to step back and decontextualize my relationship to these streaming platforms, and the methodologies of popular film and television. This experiment takes the situational context of plot elements, and removes the context, leaving only a suspiciously specific and abstract statement in its place. <br><br>
